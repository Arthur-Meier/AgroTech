/**
 * Minimal HTTP client helpers â€” fetch wrapper (TypeScript)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PURPOSE
 *  - Provide tiny, typed helpers for JSON-based HTTP requests using `fetch`.
 *  - Keep usage ergonomic with generics (callers define the expected JSON type).
 *
 * SCOPE (no behavior changes here)
 *  - Comments and documentation only. The implementation remains exactly the
 *    same, so existing call sites are unaffected.
 *
 * DESIGN NOTES
 *  - `fetch` resolves the Promise for *any* HTTP response; it only rejects on
 *    network/transport errors. We explicitly check `res.ok` and throw on non-2xx
 *    statuses so callers can handle errors with try/catch.
 *  - We assume JSON APIs and parse response bodies with `res.json()`.
 *
 * EXTENSION IDEAS (future; not implemented here)
 *  - Base URL and default headers via a higher-order factory, e.g., `createClient`.
 *  - Request timeouts with `AbortController` to avoid hanging requests.
 *  - Retries/backoff for transient 5xx responses.
 *  - Auth: attach bearer tokens from secure storage; refresh on 401.
 *  - Structured error objects mapping status codes to domain errors.

 * Perform a GET request and parse the JSON response.

 * @throws Error when the HTTP status is not in the 2xx range, with a minimal

 *
 * SECURITY & CONSISTENCY
 *  - `Content-Type: application/json` header is declared explicitly to avoid
 *    server-side content-negotiation ambiguity.
 *  - `JSON.stringify` is used as provided; callers are responsible for ensuring
 *    the payload is serializable and does not leak sensitive data accidentally.
